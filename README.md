# DAM_Success_Capstone
DAM Success: The Inaugural Year and Beyond

Executive Summary

Vanderbilt University implemented a new Digital Asset Management tool a year ago. I began working on the DAM in January and would like to provide a first year report on the DAM’s impact. The overall project includes extracting and cleaning data from the DAM, creating User Profiles, understanding their behaviors and analyzing the success rate of the DAM to-date based on particular “Success Behaviors” completed (i.e. Downloading, Sharing, or Clipboarding assets). Presentation to include an overview of the Archive currently available (total images, total images processed to-date). analysis to include asset search volume, downloads, shares, and clipboard activity. Analysis can also include User increases over the last year from initial rollout through the impact of the University under orders to work from home due to COVID-19.

Motivation

I would like to create a presentation for my department, and possibly university management, showing the impact the DAM has made just within the first year. Wins, strategies used to get where we are today, recommend goals and strategies for continue growth, and broadening asset accessibility moving forward. My motivation partly stems from wanting to show the positive impact the DAM has had for Users, and partly to educate people on next goals and strategies for success to position my role for growth within the community. 

Data Question(s)

●	What is a DAM and its purpose? How is it used?

●	A snapshot of  the DAM Community. Provide User Profiles (i.e. DAM Managers, DAM Champions, and DAM Teams, DAM Users)

●	What is the definition of DAM Success and the behaviors related to it?
  o	Downloading, Sharing, Clipboarding

●	Compare Users Search Behavior vs. Success Behavior
  o	What are the Success Behaviors vs. Search Volume? (shown in averages and percentages)
  o	How often are Users abandoning efforts without using a Success Behavior?
  o	Show a timeline of Success Rate and discuss what tasks were completed over this last year that contributed to the success rate.
  
●	Where do we go from here? Use the News Archive as a Case Study and provide recommendations for growing the DAM Community of Champions and Users.

Schedule (through 6/25/2020)

1.	Get the Data (5/29/2020)
2.	Clean & Explore the Data (6/7/2020)
3.	Create Presentation and Shiny App (6/14/2020)
4.	Internal Demos (6/19/2020) Note: This date is a Friday
5.	Demo Day (6//2020)

Data Sources

All data to be extracted from Vanderbilt University’s account of Orange Logic’s, Cortex DAM program. Interviews with Users may be necessary to support theories on workflows and activity.
Known Issues and Challenges
Doing some preliminary research of what data is captured by the DAM I won’t be able to prove productivity of Users based on time spent within the DAM, or time spent searching before they show a behavior of success. However, I may be able to determine success rate based on quantity of searches vs. success behaviors performed based on averages and/or percentages. This would lead me to understanding what is needed to improve the User experience and reduce support needs.


Programs and Process Used:
Original DataSets (Quantity 7) extracted as csv files from Cortex.
Exploration of Data performed in Excel and Python/Jupytor Notebooks.
Exploration determined that only 5 DataSets were needed.
First round of Data Cleaning performed in Excel.
Joining of DataSets performed in Python/Jupyter Notebooks.
Second Round of Data Cleaning performed in Python.
New csv DataSets saved from Python.
New Datasets imported into Tableau for building Data Story for presentation.
Python/Jupyter notebooks not included in GitHub to protect proprietary information.
